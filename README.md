# Studying FFMPEG
- For a project I want to take screenshots from a long video and wanted to test out what is the best solution to achieve by automating this instead of going frame from frame. for this project i am using node + [fluent-ffmpeg](https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg). 

## What I want to be able to do
- Grabbing good quality images from a large video about (1000+ images). 
- Select parts of the video to convert to images and maybe even add or remove amount of frames take per second. 

## What I'm working on at the moment
- Getting 10 seconds of a video and generating 50 images.

## Other Ideas
- Create jifs or short form videos. 
- Transform videos (extension, size, quality) 

### Extra Notes
Has both [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) and [fluent-ffmpeg](https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg) to do some testing.
